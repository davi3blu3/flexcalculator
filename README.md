Responsive Javascript Calculator

FreeCodeCamp.com : Advanced Front End Development Projects

Build a countdown timer that fulfills the following user needs:
User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.
User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.

This is a basic Javascript calculator using jQuery. It began here: https://github.com/davi3blu3/calculator as my response to a FreeCodeCamp challenge.  Although I was happy with the functionality overall (still a few tweaks to do) I realized my design was pretty frumpy and not responsive.  I decided to start over with the HTML / CSS and started a little experimenting with flexboxes.
