Synopsis

This is a basic Javascript calculator using jQuery. It began here: https://github.com/davi3blu3/calculator as my response to a FreeCodeCamp challenge.  Although I was happy with the functionality overall (still a few tweaks to do) I realized my design was pretty frumpy and not responsive.  I decided to start over with the HTML / CSS and started a little experimenting with flexboxes.
